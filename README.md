# ForgetNoMore


A simple python script to search through a google sheets spreadsheet to check for birthdays and send a birthday email.

Usage is basic, make sure you have the Google Sheets API installed, if you have any questions - email me at: me@seeocon.co

To change the content of the email, just write your own - replace the persons name with an 'xxx' and the script will automatically change it to the person's name that it's sending it to.


A friend requested me to create this script for him to use, and I wanted to learn more python concepts for networks, so I created this.
